Please adhere to the following Workflow!

So the workflow is pretty simple
For every feature you are working on,
Create a new branch for that feature
Then when done, create a PR against dev branch

*For example*
If I am working on login page
I will do git checkout -b login-page
In my local machine
Then when am done working on the login-page branch, I push to login-page
And create a PR to dev branch
Then someone reviews and merge.
That way, things are unique and  undo able incase of breakage
